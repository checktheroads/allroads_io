### Infrequently Asked Questions

#### What's the deal with all these roads?

Well...if you work around IT Infrastructure and *haven't* seen [this](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-its-like-network-engineer-ron-buchalski/), you haven't seen Shakespeare the way it's meant to be seen.

#### What are you trying to do here?

On top of network engineering, I very much enjoy technical writing. While I get to do a fair amount of this with my day job, I rarely get to write about what truly interests *me*. So, this an outlet for me to do so. Hopefully this is valuable to some folks other than me. But if not, that's ok too.

### What you might find here

Who knows. Lately my mindâ€™s been on stuff like whitebox routing, DDoS mitigation, bash scripting, open source tools, and messing around with sites like [readthedocs.io](https://readthedocs.io) and [GitHub Pages](https://github.io) (hence the creation of this site). But, it could be anything in these categories:

- Network protocols
- Network design concepts
- Automation
- Scripting
- Software tools
- Network diagrams
- Internet numbering resources
- Network security implementations
- Public Key Infrastructure
- Container computing & networking
- Other things I discover along the way
