# Infrequently Asked Questions

## What's the deal with all these roads?

Well...if you work around IT Infrastructure and *haven't* seen [this](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-its-like-network-engineer-ron-buchalski/), you haven't seen Shakespeare the way it's meant to be seen. Full credit to the author, [Ron Buchalski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ron-buchalski-5981081b/). Full excert at the bottom of this page.

## What are you trying to do here?

On top of network engineering, I very much enjoy technical writing. While I get to do a fair amount of this with my day job, I rarely get to write about what truly interests *me*. So, this an outlet for me to do so. Hopefully this is valuable to some folks other than me. But if not, that's ok too.

## What you might find here

Who knows. Lately my mind’s been on stuff like whitebox routing, DDoS mitigation, bash scripting, open source tools, and messing around with sites like [readthedocs.io](https://readthedocs.io) and [GitHub Pages](https://github.io) (hence the creation of this site). But, it could be anything in these categories:

- Network protocols
- Network design concepts
- Automation
- Scripting
- Software tools
- Network diagrams
- Internet numbering resources
- Network security implementations
- Public Key Infrastructure
- Container computing & networking
- Other things I discover along the way

&nbsp;
> User: I think we are having a major road issue.
&nbsp;
> Me: What? No, I just checked, the roads are fine. I was actually just on the roads.
&nbsp;
> User: No, I’m pretty sure the roads are down because I’m not getting pizzas.
&nbsp;
> Me: Everything else on the roads is fine. What do you mean you aren’t getting pizzas?
&nbsp;
> User: I used to get pizzas when I ordered them, now I’m not getting them. It has to be a road issue.
&nbsp;
> Me: As I said, the roads are fine. Where are you getting pizzas from?
&nbsp;
> User: I’m not really sure. Can you check all places that deliver pizzas?
&nbsp;
> Me: No I don’t even know all the places that deliver pizza. You need to narrow it down.
&nbsp;
> User: I think it is Subway.
&nbsp;
> Me: Okay, I’ll check…No, I just looked and Subway doesn't deliver pizzas.
&nbsp;
> User: I’m pretty sure it is Subway. Can you just allow all food from Subway and we can see if pizza shows up?
&nbsp;
> Me: Sigh, fine I’ve allowed all food from Subway, but I don’t think that is the issue.
&nbsp;
> User: Yeah I’m still not getting pizza. Can you check the roads?
&nbsp;
> Me: It’s not the roads, the roads are fine. I’m pretty sure Subway isn’t the place.
&nbsp;
> User: Okay, I found it. It’s Papa Johns.
&nbsp;
> Me: Okay, I looked and Papa Johns does deliver pizza. Is it the local Papa Johns or one in a different town?
&nbsp;
> User: I don’t know. Can you allow pizza from all Papa Johns to me?
&nbsp;
> Me: No I can’t do that. Can you get me an address for Papa Johns?
&nbsp;
> User: No, I only know it as Papa Johns. Can you get me all the addresses of all Papa Johns and I’ll tell you if one of them is correct?
&nbsp;
> Me: No, I don’t have time for that. Okay, I looked at the local one and it looks like they have sent you pizza in the past and they are currentlyllowed to send you pizzas. Try ordering a pizza while I watch.
&nbsp;
> User: Yeah still no pizza. I’m guessing they are getting blocked at the freeway. Can you check the freeway to make sure they can get through?
&nbsp;
> Me: No, this is a local delivery. They aren't even using the freeway.
&nbsp;
> User: Okay, well then it has to be a road issue.
&nbsp;
> Me: No, the roads are fine. Okay, I just drove from the Papa Johns to the address they have on file for you and there is nothing there.
&nbsp;
> User: Hmm, wait we did move recently.
&nbsp;
> Me: Did you give your new address to Papa Johns?
&nbsp;
> User: No, I just thought they would be able to look me up by name.
&nbsp;
> Me: No they need your new address. What’s your new address?
&nbsp;
> User: I’m not really sure. Can you look it up?
&nbsp;
> Me: Sigh, give me a second…Okay, I found your address and gave it to Papa Johns. Try ordering a pizza now.
&nbsp;
> User: HEY! PIZZA JUST SHOWED UP!
&nbsp;
> Me: Okay, good.
&nbsp;
> User: (To everyone else they know) I apologize for the delay in the pizza but there was a major road issue that was preventing the pizza from getting toe. The network engineer has fixed the roads and we are able to get pizza again.
&nbsp;
> Me: But it wasn’t the roads…whatever.
&nbsp;
> User: Oh, can you also check on an issue where Chinese food isn’t getting to me? I think it may be a road issue.
